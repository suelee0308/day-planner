<!-- delegate event listeners
add data attributes to assign data
use military time
start on the front end first, get boostrap containers done, get columns set up
then get save button to do its job, save the text to local storage
then worry about the time math 
jquery, we can grab all elements on a page by class and loop them, and effect their css in that loop, based on stuff
color coding things on the page is very difficult - but if you shove as much as you can in the HTML as data attributes, it will help
event delegation, event listener, this, jquery. 
look at css to see if you need those classes! existing classes mean something!
jquery and moment are connected already. boostrap is not connected
color classes need to apply based on time of day: past hour block, present or future hour block
